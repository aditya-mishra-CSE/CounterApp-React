Introducing CounterApp: A Simple React Project! ðŸ§®

I'm excited to share my latest project: CounterApp! This straightforward React application provides a simple interface for incrementing and decrementing a value. It was a great exercise in using useState for dynamic updates and event handling to manage button clicks. Tailwind CSS provided the clean, minimal styling. All the action happens in App.js, keeping the focus on core functionality. This project is a stepping stone to more complex React applications, where I'll be exploring component structures and responsiveness.
